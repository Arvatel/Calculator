## How to download

## How is it works
I used [Shunting-yard algorithm] that's why it possible to use brackets and correctly calculate with priority of operations. 
For reorganization text from expression I used regex `(\\()|(\\))|([*\\/])|(?:(?<=[\\d\\)])\\ *)([+-])|(\\-?\\ *[\\d.]+)|(\\S)` it separated symbols into *six* groups.
